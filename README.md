# MLvsTheWorld
A collection (just 2 for now) of machinelearning models optimised for mobile that mostly use the camera. Currently we have human segmentation/ background blur kind of filter and a model that just classfies whether a fruit is fresh or stale, super useful I know.

Here is a preview:

Here are the jupyter notebooks that I have used to make the models:

[The human segmentation model](HumanSegmentation.ipynb)

[The fruit freshness clasifier](FreshnessClassifier.ipynb)
